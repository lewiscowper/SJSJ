# AngularJS

[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets developers use HTML as their template language and lets them extend HTML’s syntax to express their application’s components clearly and succinctly.

Angular’s data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code developers would otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology.
