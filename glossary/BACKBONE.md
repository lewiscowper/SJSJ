# Backbone

[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) is a framework giving structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to existing APIs over a RESTful JSON interface.
