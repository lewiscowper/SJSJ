# Bower

[Bower](http://bower.io/) is a package manager for front-end dependencies. It takes care of hunting, finding, downloading, saving these dependencies and keeping track of them in a manifest file called `bower.json`. Bower uses a flat dependency tree, requiring only one version for each package, reducing page load to a minimum.
