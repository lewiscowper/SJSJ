# Broccoli

[Broccoli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli) is a fast, reliable asset pipeline, supporting constant-time rebuilds and compact build definitions. Comparable to the [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) asset pipeline in scope, though it runs on [Node.js](NODEJS.md) and is backend-agnostic.
