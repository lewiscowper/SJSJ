# Express

[Express](http://expressjs.com/en/index.html) is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for [Node.js](NODEJS.md). Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that developers already know and like. The myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware provided by Express makes creating a robust API quick and easy.
