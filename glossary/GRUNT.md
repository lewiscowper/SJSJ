# Grunt

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is a task runner aiming at automating tedious and possibly complex tasks. The idea behind Grunt (and its peer [Gulp](GULP.md)) is to define tasks that perform (usually file-based) actions. These tasks can then be run through the command line or as part of another build step.
