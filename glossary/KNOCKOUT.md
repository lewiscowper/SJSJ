# Knockout

[Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) (shortened as *KO*) is a JavaScript library that helps developers creating rich, responsive display and editor user interfaces with a clean underlying data model. Knockout helps implementing sections of UI that update dynamically (e.g. changes depending on userâ€™s actions or when external data source gets updated) more simply and maintainably.
