# Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side web applications built on Chrome’s [V8](#v8) JavaScript engine. These applications are written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime.

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O (input/output) model that makes it lightweight and efficient as well as optimized for real-time web applications’ throughput and scalability.

Its work is hosted and supported by the [Node.js Foundation](https://nodejs.org/en/foundation/), a collaborative project at Linux Foundation.
