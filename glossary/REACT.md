# React

[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is a library developed and used at Facebook for building user interfaces. It can be seen as the V in MVC (Model View Controller) as it makes no assumptions about the rest of the technology stack. Using [React Native](#react-native) it can even be used to power native apps.

In React you can write HTML directly in JS using an XML-like syntax called JSX. JSX compiles to JS and is optional, but does make the code more expressive.

Data flow in React is one-way which makes it easier to reason about and avoid mistakes. This quality can be enhanced using [Flux](FLUX.md), Facebook’s complementary application architecture, or [Redux](REDUX.md) which many people see as a “better Flux”.
