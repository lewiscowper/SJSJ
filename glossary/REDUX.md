# Redux

[Redux](http://redux.js.org/) is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, which is a fancy way of saying it controls application state and state mutations. It does so by keeping state in a store, which is the single source of truth.

Redux is an alternative to [Flux](FLUX.md) and used a lot together with [React](REACT.md), but you can use it with any other view library.
