# TypeScript

[TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a super-set of the JavaScript language that introduces types (plus interfaces and new JavaScript features). It allows type-checking during development time with supported editors such as [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The compiler requires information about the “shape” of a module in a _type-definition-file_.
