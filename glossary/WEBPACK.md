# Webpack

[Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) helps you managing dependencies in your project, and also offers a friendly and fast development environment, simplifying a lot of common tasks behind a simple configuration file. It also allows you to bundle your modules into static assets for browsers. Its killer feature is the known as [hot module replacement](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/hot-module-replacement-with-webpack), which lets your live code in the browser update automatically as you change files in your preferred editor without a page reload.
